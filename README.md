# Graph Data Structure Implementation in Python

## Overview
This Python project involves implementing a graph data structure, providing foundational functionalities for graph manipulation and algorithm implementation.

## Features
- Implementation of a graph data structure.
- Methods for adding nodes and edges to the graph.
- Additional graph-related functionalities (detailed in the code).

## Usage
To run the script:
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run `main.py` in your Python environment.

The script will execute operations related to the graph data structure as defined in the code.

## Implementation Details
- `main.py`: Contains the primary logic for the graph data structure.
- `GraphTemplate` class: Core class for graph operations.
    - Methods for adding nodes and edges.
    - Placeholders for future methods and functionalities.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Standard Python libraries: `math`, `sys`, `collections`
